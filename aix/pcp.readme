With the SP environment disappearing, it was evident that the pcp functionality
wasn't present in other hosts.  I wrote a simple parallel copy script in PERL
in order mimic that functionality.

This is horrendously out of date as of the writing of this, but still works.
It also happens to work on Linux as well.

If I hadn't found other copy mechanisms to work with, I would probably have
rewritten this in Python.  Ansible is my preferred method today however.
