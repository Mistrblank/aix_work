This script was written for an old version of the svc_collect_mdisk_data script
before I became familiar with the bytes flag to normalize all data collected.

I had to run this to normalize all data that was already collected with the new
format.

This script isn't particularly useful other than for historical purposes and to
show Parsing functionality in Perl.
