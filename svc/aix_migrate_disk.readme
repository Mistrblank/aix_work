This script was created to migrate an aix host from one SVC to another
(Subsequently that's also why I'm not sure if it belongs here or under AIX
scripts).

This script is one of the more involved ones here and is also one that I used to
focus on my Python skills.

This script is still run from an external host that has ssh access to the source
and target SVCs as well as the target host.
